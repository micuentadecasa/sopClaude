# Define Scenarios Prompt

Based on the agent scope definition, generate 5-10 concrete scenarios that demonstrate the agent's capabilities in action.

For each scenario, create a detailed description following this structure:

## Scenario Format

### Scenario [Number]: [Descriptive Title]

**Context**: [1-2 sentences describing the situation]

**Input**: [Specific input the agent receives - be very concrete]

**Agent Actions**:
1. [Step 1 - What the agent does]
2. [Step 2 - Next action]
3. [Continue with all steps...]

**Expected Output**: [Specific, measurable outcome]

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

**Edge Cases**:
- What if [edge case 1]? → [How agent handles it]
- What if [edge case 2]? → [How agent handles it]

## Requirements for Scenarios

1. Cover the full range of agent capabilities
2. Include both simple and complex scenarios
3. Address common use cases and edge cases
4. Be specific with inputs and outputs (use examples)
5. Include failure scenarios and how the agent handles them
6. Ensure scenarios are testable and measurable

Generate scenarios that progressively demonstrate more complex capabilities, starting with basic tasks and building to advanced integrations.

Make sure each scenario is:
- Realistic and based on actual user needs
- Specific enough to implement
- Measurable for testing
- Aligned with the defined agent scope
