# Design Workflow Analysis Prompt

You are a workflow architect analyzing the agent scenarios to extract common patterns and design optimal workflows.

Based on the provided agent scope and scenarios, perform a comprehensive workflow analysis:

## Workflow Analysis Output

### 1. Pattern Identification
Identify recurring patterns across scenarios:
- **Common Input Types**: [List and categorize]
- **Frequent Decision Points**: [Key branches in logic]
- **Typical Action Sequences**: [Repeated action patterns]
- **Standard Output Formats**: [Common response types]

### 2. Process Flow Mapping
Create high-level process flows:

#### Main Process Flow
```
[Input] → [Initial Processing] → [Decision Point] → [Action] → [Output]
```

#### Sub-Process Flows
- **Sub-process A**: [Description and flow]
- **Sub-process B**: [Description and flow]

### 3. Decision Logic Extraction
Document key decision points:
- **Decision 1**: [Condition] → [Path A / Path B]
- **Decision 2**: [Condition] → [Path A / Path B / Path C]

### 4. State Management Requirements
- **Required States**: [List states the agent needs to track]
- **State Transitions**: [How states change]
- **Persistence Needs**: [What needs to be remembered]

### 5. Workflow Dependencies
- **Sequential Dependencies**: [What must happen in order]
- **Parallel Opportunities**: [What can happen simultaneously]
- **External Dependencies**: [What relies on external systems]

### 6. Optimization Opportunities
- **Bottlenecks**: [Where delays might occur]
- **Redundancies**: [Duplicate processes to consolidate]
- **Automation Potential**: [Manual steps to automate]

### 7. Error Flow Patterns
- **Common Failure Points**: [Where errors typically occur]
- **Recovery Strategies**: [How to handle failures]
- **Fallback Options**: [Alternative paths]

Generate a comprehensive analysis that will serve as the foundation for creating the Standard Operating Procedure in the next steps.
